# Bioinformatics-Tutorials

## This is a collection of tutorials for biologists looking for an introduction to genomics analysis.

It's broken down into different "weeks," which each cover a different topic.  The first two weeks are primarily meant as introdcutions for those who haven't worked with R or Python before; if you're already experienced in one of those languges, then you might consider skipping ahead.

**Each week consists of a jupyter notebook written in either Python or R**.  These notebooks cover the same material, although not necessarily in the same way (based on how you might do something in Python vs. R), and take advantage of the different packages built for each language.

## Topics:

#### * Week 1: Introduction
  - General introduction to Python or R
  - Analyzing CRISPR mutation data: from FASTQs to analysis
  
#### * Week 2: Dataframes
  - How to work with a dataframe and find data of interest
  
#### * Week 3: Plotting
  - How to make plots using matplotlib or ggplot
  
#### * Week 4: scRNA general workflow
  - How to import scRNA data from a 10x Genomics experiment
  - An analysis of PBMCs: clustering and cell-type annotation
  
#### * Week 5: Incorporating CITE-seq data
  - How is CITE-seq data different than RNA-seq data?
  - How do we process and incorporate this data?
  
#### * Week 6: Looking at lymphocytes: adding in TCR (and BCR) data
  - Looking at the clonotype of each cell
  - Subsetting a particular population of interest (T cells) for a finer-grained analysis
  - Computing gene module scores
  
## Plotting:

Plotting can be tricky! If you're curious, weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 have a lot of plotting, and might be of interest:

* Week 3: general introduction to making plots
* Week 4: using the built-in plotting functions in scanpy and Seurat for scRNA
* Weeks 5 & 6: Breaking out of the scanpy/Seurat defaults to make more complex, figure-quality plots

### Tools/Packages:

#### Python:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scanpy

#### R:
  * test
  * test 
  * test
