If you haven't done any type of coding before, parts of this might be challenging - I would much rather you reach out to me if you get stuck than spend an hour getting frustrated.\n",

Then we're going to look at at <b>GTF</b> file, which is a commonly used format for storing genomic feature annotations (i.e, transcripts, exons, genes), and prepare a few convenient files linking transcript annotations to gene names and functions.  We'll also look at a file that contains information on the files that are available through **ENCODE**, as practice of how to import and filter a large dataset.\n",

And though I think I can generally figure out a way to answer most bioinformatics questions, I am by no means an expert at coding, so I'm sure that is often an alternative or more elegant solution to certain problems.  Absolutely feel free to do things slightly differently, as long as it gets you to the same answer - I'll try to walk you through how I generally do things, and point out parts that I have found useful, and do my best to explain how and why certain bits of code work.\n",
